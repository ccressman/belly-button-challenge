Using javascript, this project created an interactive dashboard to dynamically display data visualizations for a dataset cataloging microbes that colonize human navals. This was completed using the D3 library to read in data from a provided URL (https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json). 

The page includesa dropdown menu bar that, based on the underlying data of the selection, will generate a horizontal bar, bubble, and gauge charts as well as table displaying key-value pair information. A sample image of the dashboard is contained below. 

The website can be viewed at the following linK: <Note to self: enter link here>
